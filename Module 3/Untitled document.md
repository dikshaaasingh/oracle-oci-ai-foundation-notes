**MACHINE LEARNING FOUNDATIONS**

- **Introduction to Machine Learning**


**Machine Learning Foundations — Concise Notes**  
**1\. Definition**

* Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to **learn from data** and **predict outcomes** without explicit programming.  
* Powered by **algorithms** that automatically learn patterns from examples (data).

**2\. Everyday Examples**

* **E-commerce:** Product recommendations based on purchase history.  
* **Streaming Platforms:** Movie suggestions (e.g., Netflix) from viewing patterns.  
* **Email:** Spam detection based on message content.  
* **Self-driving Cars:** Learn from sensor data to navigate safely.

**3\. How ML Works**

* **Input Data:** Features (e.g., texture, color, eye shape).  
* **Labels:** Known outputs (e.g., “cat” or “dog”).  
* **Training:** Model learns relationships between features and labels.  
* **Inference:** Using the trained model to predict outcomes for new inputs.

**4\. Types of Machine Learning**

* **Supervised Learning:**  
  * Uses labeled data (input \+ output).  
  * Examples: Disease detection, weather forecasting, spam detection, credit scoring.

* **Unsupervised Learning:**  
  * Works on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or clusters.  
  * Examples: Fraud detection, customer segmentation, outlier detection, marketing campaigns.

* **Reinforcement Learning:**  
  * Learns via feedback (rewards/punishments) to make decisions.  
  * Examples: Autonomous robots, self-driving cars, game-playing AI.

**5\. Key Concept Summary**

* **Training Phase:** Model learns patterns from past data.  
* **Inference Phase:** Model applies learning to new data for prediction.  
* ML enables automation, prediction, and pattern discovery across domains.

- **Supervised Learning — Regression**  
  **Definition:**  
   Supervised learning trains models using **labeled data** (input-output pairs) to learn the mapping between them.  
    
  **Examples:**

  * **House Price Prediction:** Input – house size; Output – price  
  * **Cancer Detection:** Input – medical data; Output – malignant/benign  
  * **Sentiment Analysis:** Input – reviews; Output – sentiment label  
  * **Stock Price Prediction:** Input – stock data; Output – predicted price

**Types:**

* **Regression:** Output is **continuous** (e.g., price prediction).  
  * **Classification:** Output is **categorical** (e.g., spam/not spam).

**Regression Example (House Price):**

* Input: House size (independent variable)  
  * Output: Price (dependent variable)  
  * Relation visualized using **scatter plot**; shows positive correlation.

**Model Representation:**  
 Linear function: **f(x) \= w·x \+ b**

* **w:** Weight/slope → rate of change  
  * **b:** Bias/intercept → shifts line up/down

**Training Process:**

* Model predicts price using initial w, b.  
  * Compare prediction with actual value → find **error**.  
  * Compute **loss** \= (Predicted − Actual)².  
  * Adjust w and b iteratively to **minimize loss** (best fit line).

**Result:**  
 Trained function f(x) can predict price for any given house size.

- **Supervised Learning – Classification**  
    
* **Definition:**  
   Classification is a **supervised learning** technique used when the output is **categorical** (discrete labels).

* **Regression vs Classification:**  
  * **Regression:** Predicts **continuous** numeric values.  
  * **Classification:** Predicts **categories/labels** (e.g., spam or not spam).

* **Examples:**  
  * **Binary classification:** Spam detection (spam/not spam), Pass/Fail.  
  * **Multi-class classification:** Sentiment analysis (positive/neutral/negative), Iris flower types.

* **Process:**  
   Model is trained on **labeled data** to learn patterns between features (inputs) and classes (outputs).

* **Algorithm Example – Logistic Regression:**

  * Used for **binary** or **multi-class** classification.

  * Uses **sigmoid function** (S-shaped curve) to map outputs between **0 and 1** (interpreted as probability).

  * Formula: **f(x) \= 1 / (1 \+ e^(-z))**, where *z \= w·x \+ b*.

  * **Decision rule:**

    * If probability \> 0.5 → Class 1 (Pass)

    * If probability \< 0.5 → Class 0 (Fail)

* **Example – Pass/Fail Prediction:**  
   Input: Hours studied  
   Output: Pass or Fail

  * 6 hours → 0.8 probability → Pass

  * 4 hours → 0.2 probability → Fail

* **Multi-Class Example – Iris Dataset:**

  * **Input features:** Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

  * **Output labels:** Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica

  * Logistic regression used for multi-class classification.

- **Demo: Introduction to Jupyter Notebook**

- **Demo: Basic Machine Learning Part 1**

### **1\. Typical Machine Learning Process**

1. **Load Data** – Import dataset (e.g., CSV file).

2. **Preprocess Data** – Clean, transform, and split into features and labels.

3. **Train Model** – Feed training data to the ML algorithm.

4. **Evaluate Model** – Assess model performance on unseen data.

5. **Make Predictions** – Use trained models to predict outcomes.

### **2\. Classifier Overview**

* **Classifier:** An algorithm that assigns input data to categories based on learned patterns.

* **Task Type:** **Supervised Learning** (predicts categorical outcomes).

* **Goal:** Learn relationships between input features and output labels to classify new data.

### **3\. Libraries Used**

import pandas as pd  
from sklearn.linear\_model import LogisticRegression

* **pandas:** For data manipulation (DataFrames).

* **scikit-learn (sklearn):** Provides ML models, training, and evaluation tools.

**Installation (if missing):**

 conda install \-c anaconda scikit-learn

### **4\. Load Dataset**

iris\_data \= pd.read\_csv("iris.csv")  
iris\_data.head()

* Loads the **Iris dataset**, which contains features of iris flowers.

* **Columns:** ID, SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth, Species.

* `.head()` displays first five rows for inspection.

### **5\. Split Data into Features and Labels**

X \= iris\_data.drop(\['ID', 'Species'\], axis=1)  
y \= iris\_data\['Species'\]

* **X (features):** Flower attributes.

* **y (labels):** Species (target variable).

* `ID` column dropped since it adds no predictive value.

### **6\. Create and Train the Model**

print(predictions)

* Predicts the **species** based on new input features.

* Example output: `['Iris-setosa']`.

### **8\. Summary**

* **Process:** Data Loading → Preprocessing → Model Creation → Training → Prediction.

* **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression (Classifier).

* **Dataset Used:** Iris Dataset.

* **Outcome:** Predicted flower species based on input features.

  **Logistic Regression with Standardization, Evaluation & Prediction**

  ## **🔹 Step 1: Notebook Setup**

* Duplicated the existing notebook and renamed it as **`MLDemo2`**.

* Restarted the kernel and cleared all outputs to ensure a clean environment.

  ---

  ## **🔹 Step 2: Import Required Libraries**

  `import numpy as np`  
  `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`  
  `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`  
  `from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score`  
  `from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression`


  ### **📘 Library Roles**

| Library/Function | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **NumPy (`np`)** | Numerical computations and array handling. |
| **train\_test\_split** | Splits dataset into training and testing subsets. |
| **StandardScaler** | Standardizes features (mean \= 0, std \= 1). |
| **accuracy\_score** | Calculates accuracy of classification models. |
| **LogisticRegression** | Builds a logistic regression classification model. |

  ---

  ## **🔹 Step 3: Why Standardization Matters**

* Ensures all features are on the **same scale**.

* Prevents larger-magnitude features from **dominating the learning process**.

* Example:

  * Feature 1: Square Footage (1000–5000)

  * Feature 2: Bedrooms (1–6)

  * Without scaling, model favors Square Footage → leads to bias.

  * Standardization resolves this imbalance.

**Formula:**  
z=x−μσz \= \\frac{x \- \\mu}{\\sigma}z=σx−μ​  
where

* μ\\muμ \= mean of feature

* σ\\sigmaσ \= standard deviation

  ---

  ## **🔹 Step 4: Train-Test Split**

  `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(`  
      `X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42`  
  `)`  
    
* **`random_state`** ensures reproducibility of the data split.

* **Training set:** used to train the model.

* **Testing set:** used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

  ---

  ## **🔹 Step 5: Feature Standardization**

  `scaler = StandardScaler()`  
  `X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)`  
  `X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)`  
    
* `fit_transform` → learns scaling parameters from training data.

* `transform` → applies same scaling to test data.

  ---

  ## **🔹 Step 6: Model Creation & Training**

  `model = LogisticRegression()`  
  `model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`  
    
* The model **learns relationships** between standardized features and target labels.

  ---

  ## **🔹 Step 7: Model Evaluation**

  `y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)`  
  `accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)`  
  `print("Accuracy:", accuracy)`  
    
* Measures model performance on unseen (test) data.

* If accuracy \= **1.0 → 100% correct predictions**.

* **Higher accuracy → Better generalization**.

  ### **🧩 Concept: Model Validation**

* Evaluating model on unseen data ensures it **generalizes** well.

* Prevents **overfitting** — where the model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns.

  ---

  ## **🔹 Step 8: Predicting on New Data**

  `new_data = np.array([`  
      `[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2],`  
      `[6.2, 3.4, 5.4, 2.3],`  
      `[5.9, 3.0, 4.2, 1.5]`  
  `])`  
    
  `new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)`  
  `predictions = model.predict(new_data_scaled)`  
  `print(predictions)`


  ### **Output (Example)**

  `['Iris-setosa' 'Iris-virginica' 'Iris-setosa']`  
    
* Each row represents one sample (flower).

* Model predicts its **species** based on attributes.

  ---

✅ Data loading & preprocessing  
 ✅ Train-test splitting  
 ✅ Standardization (scaling)  
 ✅ Model training (Logistic Regression)  
 ✅ Evaluation (Accuracy Score)

---

## **🧾 Key Takeaways**

* **Standardization** ensures fair treatment of all features.

* **Reproducibility** achieved via `random_state`.

* **Accuracy Score** quantifies performance.

* **Validation** ensures the model generalizes and avoids overfitting.

* **End-to-End ML workflow** includes preprocessing → training → evaluation → prediction.

- # **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

## **🔹 Overview**

Unsupervised machine learning is a type of ML where **no labeled outputs** are provided.  
 The algorithm **learns patterns and relationships** in data to **group similar items** automatically.  
---

## **🔹 Simple Analogy**

### **🧩 Example 1: LEGO Blocks**

* A child is given a mix of LEGO pieces without labels.

* They might group them by **color**, **size**, or **shape** — depending on observed patterns.  
   → This is **unsupervised learning** — discovering structure without being told what it is.

### **🍎 Example 2: Fruits Basket**

* A basket has apples, bananas, and oranges.

* The algorithm groups **round red fruits** (apples) together, and **long yellow ones** (bananas) separately.  
   → Each group \= a **cluster**.

---

## **🔹 Clustering Concept**

**Clustering** \= grouping data items based on similarity.

* Items **within a cluster** are more similar to each other than to items **outside the cluster**.

* Items that don’t fit any group are **outliers**.

🫐 *Example:* Grapes differ in shape and color from apples, pears, and strawberries → grapes become an **outlier**.  
---

## **🔹 Key Use Cases of Unsupervised ML**

| Use Case | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Market Segmentation** | Group customers by behavior and preferences. | Shoppers buying protein products can be shown sports ads. |
| **Outlier Analysis** | Detect unusual data points or frauds. | Banks use clustering to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. |
| **Recommendation Systems** | Group users by content preferences. | Netflix clusters users by movie genres to recommend new titles. |

---

## **🔹 Concept of Similarity**

**Similarity** → how close two data points are (value between 0 and 1).

* Closer to **1** → more similar.

* Closer to **0** → less similar.

🍎 Example: Apple and Cherry have high similarity based on color → similarity ≈ 1\.  
---

## **🔹 Common Similarity Metrics**

| Metric | Description | Use Case |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Euclidean Distance** | Straight-line distance between two points. | Continuous numerical data. |
| **Manhattan Distance** | Sum of absolute differences (grid-like distance). | Spatial or city-block data. |
| **Cosine Similarity** | Measures angle between two vectors. | Text and document similarity. |
| **Jaccard Similarity** | Compares overlap between sets. | Categorical or binary attributes. |

---

## **🔹 Steps in Unsupervised ML Workflow**

1. **Prepare the Data**

   * Handle missing values

   * Normalize features

   * Perform feature scaling

2. **Create a Similarity Matrix**

   * Choose a similarity metric (e.g., Euclidean, Cosine, etc.)

   * Build a matrix showing pairwise similarity scores between items.

3. **Run a Clustering Algorithm**

   * Algorithm uses the similarity matrix to form clusters.

   * Common types:

     * **Partition-based (K-Means)**

     * **Hierarchical-based**

     * **Density-based (DBSCAN)**

     * **Distribution-based (Gaussian Mixture Models)**

4. **Interpret and Refine Results**

   * No labeled “ground truth” → evaluation is **iterative**.

   * Check:

     * Whether clusters make logical sense

     * Distribution of data within clusters

   * Adjust preprocessing, similarity metric, or algorithm parameters to improve results.

## **Summary**

Unsupervised learning finds **hidden structures** in unlabeled data.  
**Clustering** is the most common method.  
**Similarity metrics** define how items are grouped.  
Used widely in **marketing, fraud detection, and recommendation systems**.  
Evaluation is **exploratory and iterative** — requires domain understanding.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**


## **Overview**

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a type of machine learning where an **agent learns by interacting with an environment**, receiving **rewards or penalties** based on its actions — **without any labeled data**.  
Think of it as **teaching a dog new tricks** — rewarding good behavior and discouraging bad actions until it learns the optimal way to behave.

**Real-Life Examples of Reinforcement Learning**

| Domain | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Autonomous Vehicles** | Learns to drive safely using feedback from sensors and environment. | Self-driving cars, drones |
| **Smart Home Devices** | Adapts to user preferences and voice commands. | Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri |
| **Industrial Automation** | Optimizes robotic performance and efficiency. | Factory robots and control systems |
| **Gaming & Entertainment** | Creates intelligent, adaptive opponents. | AI in video games that learn from players |

**Key RL Terminology (Using Self-Driving Car Example)**

| Term | Explanation | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Agent** | Learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment. | The car’s AI system |
| **Environment** | The world the agent interacts with and receives feedback from. | The road and surroundings |
| **State (s)** | Current situation of the environment observed by the agent. | What the car sees via its camera |
| **Action (a)** | The possible moves the agent can make. | Turn left, right, or go straight |
| **Reward (r)** | Feedback for an action; positive or negative. | \+1 for staying on track, −1 for veering off |
| **Policy (π)** | The strategy or mapping from states to actions. | The car’s learned rule for steering |

## **How Reinforcement Learning Works**

1. **Interaction:**  
    The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions.  
2. **Feedback:**  
    The environment returns a **reward or penalty** based on the agent’s action.  
3. **Learning:**  
    The agent updates its **policy (strategy)** to maximize cumulative rewards.  
4. **Iteration:**  
    This process repeats — gradually improving performance and decision-making.

## **Dog Training Analogy** 

| Concept | Dog Training | Reinforcement Learning |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Agent** | The dog | The AI system |
| **Environment** | Training space | The problem setup (e.g., road, warehouse) |
| **Reward/Penalty** | Treats or scolding | Positive or negative numerical feedback |
| **Policy** | Dog’s learned behavior | Algorithm’s learned decision strategy |

## **Goal of RL**

The **goal** is to find an **optimal policy (π\*)**, which gives the **maximum total reward** over time.  
Formally:  
 \[  
 π^\* \= \\arg\\max\_{π} \\mathbb{E} \\left\[ \\sum\_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t r\_t \\right\]  
 \]  
Where:

* ( r\_t ): reward at time *t*

* ( \\gamma ): discount factor (future reward importance)

* ( π ): policy (strategy)

## **Common Algorithms**

| Algorithm | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Q-Learning** | Learns a value (Q-value) for each state-action pair, updating it iteratively. |
| **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** | Uses a neural network to approximate Q-values for large state spaces. |
| **SARSA** | Similar to Q-learning but updates values based on the *current* policy’s actions. |

## **Example: Robotic Arm in a Warehouse**

1. **Environment Setup:**  
   * Warehouse layout  
   * Robotic arm  
   * Goods and target positions

2. **State Representation:**  
   * Arm’s position and orientation  
   * Item positions  
   * Target locations

3. **Action Space:**  
   * Pick, move, place, rotate, or stop

4. **Rewards and Penalties:**  
   * Reward: Successfully placing an item correctly  
   * Penalty: Dropping or damaging items  
       
5. **Training Process:**  
   * The agent starts exploring actions randomly  
   * Observes which actions lead to high rewards.  
   * Gradually refines its **policy** to prioritize good actions.  
   * Over many iterations, it **learns optimal behavior** for efficient item placement.

## **Summary**

* Reinforcement Learning trains agents through **trial and feedback** rather than label.   
* It is driven by **rewards** and **penalties** to optimize long-term success.  
* Core components: **Agent, Environment, State, Action, Policy, Reward**.  
* Used in **self-driving cars, robotics, gaming, and personalized AI systems**.  
* Goal: Discover the **optimal policy** that maximizes total rewards.
